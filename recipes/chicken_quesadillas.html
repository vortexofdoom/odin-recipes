    <p>This delicious recipe is prepared by using adobo seasoned grilled boneless chicken thighs, layering tortillas with a combination of the chicken, cheese, and onion, and heating directly on the grill. Serve with salsa and sour cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>12 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) can diced green chilies, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken on a plate, and sprinkle with adobo seasoning on both sides. Let it marinate for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Heat grill for medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on grill, and cook for 10 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. Remove chicken from grill, and cut into bite-size pieces. </li>
        <li>Place one or two tortillas on the grill, and sprinkle with a thin layer of cheese, chicken, onion, olives, and chiles. Top with another tortilla, and grill until brown and crispy on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut into wedges to serve. </li>
