    <h1>Penne with Vodka Sauce</h1>
    <img src="../images/penne_vodka_sauce.webp" alt="Penne with a delicious vodka tomato cream sauce">
    <p>This spicy vodka pasta is a nice change from your typical tomato sauce. If you're worried about the alcohol, don't be! It cooks off and cannot be tasted. It simply helps to enhance the flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb uncooked penne pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vodka</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove casing from sausage and add to the skillet. Cook and stir until crumbly and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is golden brown. </li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add cream and vodka; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and add pasta; toss for 1 minute. Stir in parsley; serve warm. </li>
    </ol>
